### Important disclaimer

‚ö†Ô∏è We want to keep this package light and sweet, if you want to propose adding a new TLDs or Domain, make sure to justify why it's important:

1. How popular is the TLDs or Domain?
2. Why most of the companies using this package will get benefit of it?

If you are going to propose add a french version for "gov", this is more likely an edge case and we'll be discarded. You can always pass your custom list of domains as we explain in the README.
